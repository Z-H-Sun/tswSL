# If the program fails to automatically find the handle of the window or process ID of TSW, uncomment the following lines and manually assign them here:
# $hWnd = 0x0
# $pID = 0

# If you installed TSW elsewhere, and tswSL failed to find the SAVEDAT path (which is unlikely)
# You can mannually assign it here, e.g. %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Tower of the Sorcerer\Savedat
# SAVEDAT_PATH = File.join(ENV['userprofile'], 'AppData\Local\Tower of the Sorcerer\Savedat')

# The following lines modifies the SaveTemp 1-8/custom hotkeys to be Winkey+F1-9
# and LoadTemp 1-8/custom hotkeys to be Ctrl+Shift+F1-9
# Note: the change of KEY will affect both SaveTemp and LoadTemp commands
# and the change of MODIFIERS will affect all saving or loading commands
MODIFIER[1] = 8 # Win
KEY[0..8] = (112..120).to_a # F1-F9
# The following lines modifies the Quit hotkey to be Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Z:
KEY[9] = 90 # Z
# And so on.
