# If the program fails to automatically find the handle of the window or process ID of TSW, uncomment the following lines and manually assign them here:
# $hWnd = 0x0
# $pID = 0

# The following lines modifies the Save Any Data hotkeys to be Ctrl+F1; Quit hotkeys to Ctrl+Bksp
# and Load Any Data hotkeys to be Alt+F1
# Note: the change of SL_HOTKEYS will affect both Save Any Data and Load Any Data commands
# and the change of SL_MODIFIERS[0] will both load commands; SL_MODIFIERS[1], both save and quit commands
SL_MODIFIERS[1] = 2
SL_HOTKEYS[0] = 112

# And so on.
